The author had the opportunity to examine the infectivity of COVID-19 during the incubation period by conducting an epidemiological survey on a confirmed patient who had visited Jeju Island during the incubation period. The epidemiological findings support the claim that the COVID-19 virus does not have infectivity during the incubation period.\n",

      "Abstract:  Myxoviruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are major human pathogens, mandating the development of novel therapeutics. To establish a high-throughput screening protocol for the simultaneous identification of pathogen- and host-targeted hit candidates against either or both pathogens, we have attempted coinfection of cells with IAV and RSV. However, viral replication kinetics were incompatible, RSV signal window was low, and an IAV-driven minireplicon reporter assay used in initial screens narrowed the host cell range and restricted to single-cycle infections. To overcome these limitations, we developed an RSV strain carrying firefly luciferase fused to an innovative universal small-molecule assisted shut-off domain, which boosted assay signal window, and a hyperactive fusion protein that synchronized IAV and RSV reporter expression kinetics and suppresses the identification of RSV entry inhibitors sensitive to a recently reported RSV pan-resistance mechanism. Combined with a replication-competent recombinant IAV strain harboring nano-luciferase, the assay performed well on a human respiratory cell line and supports multi-cycle infections. Miniaturized to 384-well format, the protocol was validated through screening of a set of the NIH Clinical Collection (NCC) in quadruplicate. These test screens demonstrated favorable assay parameters and reproducibility. Application to a LOPAC library of bioactive compounds in a proof-of-concept campaign detected licensed anti-myxovirus therapeutics, ribavirin and the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, and identified two unexpected RSV-specific hit candidates, Fenretinide and the opioid receptor antagonist BNTX-7. Hits were evaluated in direct and orthogonal dose-response counterscreens using a standard recRSV reporter strain expressing renilla luciferase.\n",

      "Title:  Early efforts in modeling the incubation period of infectious diseases with an acute course of illness\n",
      "Abstract:  The incubation period of infectious diseases, the time from infection with a microorganism to onset of disease, is directly relevant to prevention and control. Since explicit models of the incubation period enhance our understanding of the spread of disease, previous classic studies were revisited, focusing on the modeling methods employed and paying particular attention to relatively unknown historical efforts. The earliest study on the incubation period of pandemic influenza was published in 1919, providing estimates of the incubation period of Spanish flu using the daily incidence on ships departing from several ports in Australia. Although the study explicitly dealt with an unknown time of exposure, the assumed periods of exposure, which had an equal probability of infection, were too long, and thus, likely resulted in slight underestimates of the incubation period. After the suggestion that the incubation period follows lognormal distribution, Japanese epidemiologists extended this assumption to estimates of the time of exposure during a point source outbreak. Although the reason why the incubation period of acute infectious diseases tends to reveal a right-skewed distribution has been explored several times, the validity of the lognormal assumption is yet to be fully clarified. At present, various different distributions are assumed, and the lack of validity in assuming lognormal distribution is particularly apparent in the case of slowly progressing diseases. The present paper indicates that (1) analysis using well-defined short periods of exposure with appropriate statistical methods is critical when the exact time of exposure is unknown, and (2) when assuming a specific distribution for the incubation period, comparisons using different distributions are needed in addition to estimations using different datasets, analyses of the determinants of incubation period, and an understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms.\n",

       " 'text': 'The lessons that can be learnt from the presented discussion are as follows: (I) although it is historically remarkable that the incubation period of pandemic influenza was assessed based on an explicit understanding of an unknown time of exposure, the assumed periods of exposure were too long and equal probability of exposure was assumed for each possible date. Well-defined short periods of exposure are needed to decipher the incubation period distribution using appropriate statistical methods. Taking this point into account will be critically important in estimating the incubation period of newly emerging diseases in the future. (II) The epidemiologic usefulness of the lognormal assumption was highlighted with respect to the basic characteristics of lognormal distribution, but this assumption is likely to remain unwarrantable until details of disease mechanisms are fully clarified; thus, this assumption may be merely an approximation of the rightskewed distribution. For example, considering the mechanisms of disease development, the lognormal assumption does not hold for HIV/AIDS and prion diseases. However, this limitation of the lognormal assumption does not imply that such approximation of the incubation period distribution is meaningless. Rather, it suggests that when parametric models are assumed, it is at least necessary to compare the goodness-of-fit for several distributions in order to overcome some of the uncertainty. Various datasets on the same disease would also help assess the uncertainty. Further, it would be informative if the determinants could be clarified even by simple stratifications (e.g., with respect to sex, age and genetic factors). Ideally, assumptions in the future should be supported by a detailed understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms provided by observations of within-host dynamics. Since the incubation period of infectious diseases is directly relevant to prevention and control, and because such knowledge can enhance our theoretical understanding of the spread of disease, further clarifications of the above points are deemed necessary.

       " 'text': 'The present study revisited previous works concerned with models of the incubation period of acute infectious diseases. In particular, the following were highlighted: (i) the earliest modeling effort conducted using incomplete data of a pandemic influenza, (ii) the explicit distribution of the incubation period, (iii) the application of a lognormal assumption to estimations of the time of exposure during a point source outbreak, and (iv) the validity of assuming lognormal distribution for the incubation period. Although it was not highlighted in the present paper, Norman T. J. Bailey also formed a framework using a chain binomial model, which is useful for household transmission data [103, 104] . This method estimates the incubation period as the sum of the mean latent period, which follows normal distribution, and a further fixed infectious period; however, the estimated period does not precisely imply the incubation period, but rather is closer to what is presently referred to as the serial interval [48, 105] . That is, the incubation period that can be extracted from household transmission data remains to be clarified.'}"
