    "# Task-related articles and sentences retrieval based on two-level of tf-idf with result summary for each task.\n",
    "#### Goal\n",
    "Given a large number of literature and queries of interest, retrieve the most relevant information to the queries from the literature. \n",
    "#### Approach\n",
    "Since there is no ground-truth answer to each task, we model each task as an information retrieval problem and adopt the tf-idf features to quantize the similarity between queries of each task and articles. Specifically, we implement a two-level tf-idf information retrieval system. On the first level, the most relevant articles are retrieved for each task. On the second level, the most relevant sentences are retrieved from the articles retrieved on the first level. The articles/sentences are ranked based on cosine similarity between tf-idf feature vectors of articles/sentences and the target query. The same approach is applicable to all 10 tasks in this challenge. Once all the articles are vectorized and indexed, they can be reloaded to quickly respond to different queries of different tasks without re-training.\n",
    "#### Afterwards analyses\n",
    "At the end of this notebook, we also provide a mixed short-cut for the articles and sentences we retrieved for each of the 10 tasks. This summary of results may not represent a professional or comprehensive analysis of all available COVID-19 studies so far, but may still serve as a reference that we hope may help inspire further examinations. We are submitting the same notebook to all tasks since many tasks are highly correlated and the reviewers of one task may also be interested to see the results of other tasks."

We pay more attention to the abstracts as an abstract is usually a high-level summary of the discovery of a study, thus it is information-enriched. In addition, while less than half of the articles have a full-text available, most articles have an abstract provided."

    "# II. Article and sentence retrieval\n",
    "Now let's start building the system for article and sentence retrieval. For the first level of retrieving articles, we build a tf-idf vectorizer for all articles based on their abstracts. Therefore, whether an article is considered related to a query is only based on the content in its abstract. The reasons we didn't include all text from the article is that 1. most articles don't have a full-text available; 2. abstract as a high-level summary of the discovery of the article is more information-enriched compared to the full-text; 3. only including the abstract will largely reduce the vectorizer learning time. For the second level of retrieving sentences, we first retrieving relevant articles. Then from the abstracts and paragraphs in discussion and/or conclusion sections (if exist) of the articles build a second vectorizer and retrieve the most relevant sentences. The reason we only take abstract, discussion and conclusion into consideration is that for most tasks in this challenge, the questions of interest are mostly high-level questions, to which the related information is more likely to be in summary sections rather than experiments or results sections.

METHODS: We estimated the association between the length of the incubation period and the severity of infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, using data from the epidemic in 2003 in Hong Kong. RESULTS: We estimated the incubation period of SARS based on a subset of patients with available data on exposure periods and a separate subset of patients in a putative common source outbreak, and we found significant associations between shorter incubation period and greater severity in both groups after adjusting for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients with a shorter incubation period proceeded to have more severe disease. Further studies are needed to investigate potential biological mechanisms for this association.\n",

The author had the opportunity to examine the infectivity of COVID-19 during the incubation period by conducting an epidemiological survey on a confirmed patient who had visited Jeju Island during the incubation period. The epidemiological findings support the claim that the COVID-19 virus does not have infectivity during the incubation period.\n",

      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Research evidence exists that poor prognosis is common in Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) patients. OBJECTIVES: This study estimates recovery delay intervals and identifies associated factors in a sample of Saudi Arabian patients admitted for suspected MERS‐CoV and diagnosed by rRT‐PCR assay. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective study was conducted on 829 patients admitted between September 2012 and June 2016 and diagnosed by rRT‐PCR procedures to have MERS‐CoV and non‐MERS‐CoV infection in which 396 achieved recovery. Detailed medical charts were reviewed for each patient who achieved recovery. Time intervals in days were calculated from presentation to the initial rRT‐PCR diagnosis (diagnosis delay) and from the initial rRT‐PCR diagnosis to recovery (recovery delay). RESULTS: The median recovery delay in our sample was 5 days. According to the multivariate negative binomial model, elderly (age ≥ 65), MERS‐CoV infection, ICU admission, and abnormal radiology findings were associated with longer recovery delay (adjusted relative risk (aRR): 1.741, 2.138, 2.048, and 1.473, respectively). Camel contact and the presence of respiratory symptoms at presentation were associated with a shorter recovery delay (expedited recovery) (aRR: 0.267 and 0.537, respectively). Diagnosis delay is a positive predictor for recovery delay (r = .421; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The study evidence supports that longer recovery delay was seen in patients of older age, MERS‐CoV infection, ICU admission, and abnormal radiology findings. Shorter recovery delay was found in patients who had camel contact and respiratory symptoms at presentation. These findings may help us understand clinical decision making on directing hospital resources toward prompt screening, monitoring, and implementing clinical recovery and treatment strategies.\n",

      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been detected in children with upper and lower respiratory symptoms but little is known about their relationship with severe respiratory illness. OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of HCoV species among children hospitalized for acute respiratory illness and/or fever with asymptomatic controls and to assess the severity of outcomes among hospitalized children with HCoV compared with other respiratory viruses. METHODS: From December 2003–April 2004 and October 2004–April 2005, we conducted prospective, population-based surveillance of children <5 years of age hospitalized for ARI/fever in three U.S. counties. Asymptomatic outpatient controls were enrolled concurrently. Nasal/throat swabs were tested for HCoV species HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43 by RT-PCR. Specimens from hospitalized children were also tested for other common respiratory viruses. Demographic and medical data were collected by parent/guardian interview and medical chart review. RESULTS: Overall, HCoV was detected in 113 (7.6%) of 1,481 hospitalized children (83 [5.7%] after excluding 30 cases coinfected with other viruses) and 53 (7.1%) of 742 controls. The prevalence of HCoV or individual species was not significantly higher among hospitalized children than controls. Hospitalized children testing positive for HCoV alone tended to be less ill than those infected with other viruses, while those coinfected with HCoV and other viruses were clinically similar to those infected with other viruses alone. CONCLUSION: In this study of children hospitalized for acute respiratory illness and/or fever, HCoV infection was not associated with hospitalization or with increased severity of illness.\n",

      "Title:  Epidemiology and Clinical Presentations of the Four Human Coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 Detected over 3 Years Using a Novel Multiplex Real-Time PCR Method\n",
      "Abstract:  Four human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) are associated with a range of respiratory outcomes, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Their epidemiologies and clinical characteristics are poorly described and are often reliant on case reports. To address these problems, we conducted a large-scale comprehensive screening for all four coronaviruses by analysis of 11,661 diagnostic respiratory samples collected in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, over 3 years between July 2006 and June 2009 using a novel four-way multiplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay. Coronaviruses were detected in 0.3 to 0.85% of samples in all age groups. Generally, coronaviruses displayed marked winter seasonality between the months of December and April and were not detected in summer months, which is comparable to the pattern seen with influenza viruses. HCoV-229E was the exception; detection was confined to the winter of 2008 and was sporadic in the following year. There were additional longer-term differences in detection frequencies between seasons, with HCoV-OC43 predominant in the first and third seasons and HCoV-HKU1 dominating in the second (see Results for definitions of seasons). A total of 11 to 41% of coronaviruses detected were in samples testing positive for other respiratory viruses, although clinical presentations of coronavirus monoinfections were comparable to those of viruses which have an established role in respiratory disease, such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and parainfluenza viruses. The novel multiplex assay for real-time pan-coronavirus detection enhances respiratory virus diagnosis, overcomes potential diagnostic problems arising through seasonal variation in coronavirus frequency, and provides novel insights into the epidemiology and clinical implications of coronaviruses.\n",

      "Title:  Other Respiratory Viruses Are Important Contributors to Adult Respiratory Hospitalizations and Mortality Even During Peak Weeks of the Influenza Season\n",
      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND:  During peak weeks of seasonal influenza epidemics, severe respiratory infections without laboratory confirmation are typically attributed to influenza. METHODS:  In this prospective study, specimens and demographic and clinical data were collected from adults admitted with respiratory symptoms to 4 hospitals during the 8–10 peak weeks of 2 influenza seasons. Specimens were systematically tested for influenza and 13 other respiratory viruses (ORVs) by using the Luminex RVP FAST assay. RESULTS:  At least 1 respiratory virus was identified in 46% (21% influenza, 25% noninfluenza; 2% coinfection) of the 286 enrolled patients in 2011–2012 and in 62% (46% influenza, 16% noninfluenza; 3% coinfection) of the 396 enrolled patients in 2012–2013. Among patients aged ≥75 years, twice as many ORVs (32%) as influenza viruses (14%) were detected in 2011–2012. During both seasons, the most frequently detected ORVs were enteroviruses/rhinoviruses (7%), respiratory syncytial virus (6%), human metapneumovirus (5%), coronaviruses (4%), and parainfluenza viruses (2%). Disease severity was similar for influenza and ORVs during both seasons. CONCLUSIONS:  Although ORV contribution relative to influenza varies by age and season, during the peak weeks of certain influenza seasons, ORVs may be a more frequent cause of elderly hospitalization than influenza.\n",

      "Abstract:  Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) remains a notable disease and poses a significant threat to global public health. The Arabian Peninsula is considered a major global epicentre for the disease and the virus has crossed regional and continental boundaries since 2012. In this study, we focused on exploring the temporal dynamics of MERS-CoV in human populations in the Arabian Peninsula between 2012 and 2017, using publicly available data on case counts and combining two analytical methods. Disease progression was assessed by quantifying the time-dependent reproductive number (TD-Rs), while case series temporal pattern was modelled using the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). We accounted for geographical variability between three major affected regions in Saudi Arabia including Eastern Province, Riyadh and Makkah. In Saudi Arabia, the epidemic size was large with TD-Rs >1, indicating significant spread until 2017. In both Makkah and Riyadh regions, the epidemic progression reached its peak in April 2014 (TD-Rs > 7), during the highest incidence period of MERS-CoV cases. In Eastern Province, one unique super-spreading event (TD-R > 10) was identified in May 2013, which comprised of the most notable cases of human-to-human transmission. Best-fitting ARIMA model inferred statistically significant biannual seasonality in Riyadh region, a region characterised by heavy seasonal camel-related activities. However, no statistical evidence of seasonality was identified in Eastern Province and Makkah. Instead, both areas were marked by an endemic pattern of cases with sporadic outbreaks. Our study suggested new insights into the epidemiology of the virus, including inferences about epidemic progression and evidence for seasonality. Despite the inherent limitations of the available data, our conclusions provide further guidance to currently implement risk-based surveillance in high-risk populations and, subsequently, improve related interventions strategies against the epidemic at country and regional levels.\n",

      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Surveillance of influenza-like illness (ILI) in Central Africa began only recently, and few data are therefore available on the circulation of influenza virus and other respiratory viruses. In Gabon, a Central African country, we established a surveillance network in four major towns in order to analyze cases of ILI among patients who visited health centers between March 2010 and June 2011, and to determine the viral etiology. METHODS: Nasal swabs were sent for analysis to the Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville, where they were screened for 17 respiratory viruses in a multiplex real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for all pathogens according the following pairs: adenovirus/parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus/human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/parainfluenza virus 2, pandemic influenza virus A/seasonal influenza virus A (H1N1, H3N2)/seasonal influenza virus B, human coronaviruses 229E/OC43, human coronaviruses NL63/HKU1, rhinovirus/human parechovirus, and enterovirus/parainfluenza virus 3. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 1041 specimens, of which 639 (61%) were positive for at least one virus. Three-quarters of the patients were children under five years old. We therefore focused on this age group, in which 68.1% of patients were positive for at least one virus. The most common viruses were adenoviruses (17.5%), followed by parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1–4 (16.8%), enteroviruses (EV) (14.7%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (13.5%), and influenza virus (11.9%). The prevalence of some viruses was subject to geographic and seasonal variations. One-third of positive samples contained more than one virus. CONCLUSIONS: Like most studies in the world, the virus PIVs, EV, RSV, Influenza virus, HRV were predominant among children under five years old in Gabon. An exception is made for adenoviruses which have a high prevalence in our study. However adenoviruses can be detected in asymptomatic persons. These finding gave a better knowledge of the circulation and the seasonality of the viruses involved in ILI in Gabon.\n",

      "Abstract:  The Coronaviridae family, an enveloped RNA virus family, and, more particularly, human coronaviruses (HCoV), were historically known to be responsible for a large portion of common colds and other upper respiratory tract infections. HCoV are now known to be involved in more serious respiratory diseases, i.e. bronchitis, bronchiolitis or pneumonia, especially in young children and neonates, elderly people and immunosuppressed patients. They have also been involved in nosocomial viral infections. In 2002–2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), due to a newly discovered coronavirus, the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV); led to a new awareness of the medical importance of the Coronaviridae family. This pathogen, responsible for an emerging disease in humans, with high risk of fatal outcome; underline the pressing need for new approaches to the management of the infection, and primarily to its prevention. Another interesting feature of coronaviruses is their potential environmental resistance, despite the accepted fragility of enveloped viruses. Indeed, several studies have described the ability of HCoVs (i.e. HCoV 229E, HCoV OC43 (also known as betacoronavirus 1), NL63, HKU1 or SARS-CoV) to survive in different environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and humidity), on different supports found in hospital settings such as aluminum, sterile sponges or latex surgical gloves or in biological fluids. Finally, taking into account the persisting lack of specific antiviral treatments (there is, in fact, no specific treatment available to fight coronaviruses infections), the Coronaviridae specificities (i.e. pathogenicity, potential environmental resistance) make them a challenging model for the development of efficient means of prevention, as an adapted antisepsis-disinfection, to prevent the environmental spread of such infective agents. This review will summarize current knowledge on the capacity of human coronaviruses to survive in the environment and the efficacy of well-known antiseptic-disinfectants against them, with particular focus on the development of new methodologies to evaluate the activity of new antiseptic-disinfectants on viruses.\n",

      "Abstract:  The coronavirus membrane (M) protein carboxy tail interacts with the nucleocapsid during virus assembly. Previous studies demonstrated that the two terminal residues are important, and the charged residue (R227) in the penultimate position in the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) A59 M protein was suggested to participate in intermolecular interactions with negative charges in the nucleocapsid (N) protein. To determine the significance of the positive charge at position 227, we substituted the arginine with lysine (K), aspartic acid (D), glutamic acid (E), or alanine (A) and studied these by reverse genetics in the context of a MHV full-length infectious clone. Viruses with wild-type phenotype were readily recovered with the K or A substitutions. In contrast, negative-charge substitutions were not tolerated as well. In all recovered R227D viruses the negative charge was replaced with heterologous residues resulting from apparent template switching during negative-strand synthesis of subgenomic RNA 7. An additional second-site compensatory V202I substitution was present in some viruses. Recovered R227E viruses had second-site changes within the M protein carboxy tail that were partially compensatory. Significantly, most of the second site changes in the R227E mutant viruses were previously shown to compensate for the removal of negative charges in the N protein. Our results strongly indicate that a positive charge is not absolutely required. It is clear that other regions within the tail must also be involved in helping mediate interactions between the M protein and the nucleocapsid.\n",

      "Abstract:  The coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein is a multifunctional viral gene product that encapsidates the RNA genome and also plays some as yet not fully defined role in viral RNA replication and/or transcription. A number of conserved negatively charged amino acids are located within domain III in the carboxy end of all coronavirus N proteins. Previous studies suggested that the negatively charged residues are involved in virus assembly by mediating interaction between the membrane (M) protein carboxy tail and nucleocapsids. To determine the importance of these negatively charged residues, a series of alanine and other charged-residue substitutions were introduced in place of those in the N gene within a mouse hepatitis coronavirus A59 infectious clone. Aspartic acid residues 440 and 441 were identified as functionally important. Viruses could not be isolated when both residues were replaced by positively charged amino acids. When either amino acid was replaced by a positively charged residue or both were changed to alanine, viruses were recovered that contained second-site changes within N, but not in the M or envelope protein. The compensatory role of the new changes was confirmed by the construction of new viruses. A few viruses were recovered that retained the D(441)-to-arginine change and no compensatory changes. These viruses exhibited a small-plaque phenotype and produced significantly less virus. Overall, results from our analysis of a large panel of plaque-purified recovered viruses indicate that the negatively charged residues at positions 440 and 441 are key residues that appear to be involved in virus assembly.\n",

      "Abstract:  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease of serious consequences caused by MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Saudi communities still lack awareness of available protective measures to prevent the transmission of the virus. It is necessary to explore the current information-seeking strategies and preferences for communication tools among the Saudi population to promote dissemination of accurate information. Guided by McGuire’s Input–Output Persuasion Model and focusing on input variables (receiver characteristics, sources, message, channel and destination), we explored the current information-seeking strategies and preferences for different communication tools among residents of Riyadh (n = 658). Preferred and sought-after information sources on MERS. Most participants in the sample were female (61.7%), and the majority (98.2%) had internet access at home. The internet was the most commonly used source of information (39.5%) and the most endorsed channel for a MERS awareness campaign. Physicians were the preferred source of information (45.6%), followed by other health care providers (31.3%). In univariate multinomial logistic regression models, males and individuals aged ≤27 years were more likely to seek information from the internet than from physicians. Residents of southern and western Riyadh preferred physicians as a credible source of information over the Ministry of Health. The results of this survey provide valuable information on how to reach this population and for understanding how to launch an effective MERS risk communication campaign in a Saudi population.\n",

      "Abstract:  Assessment of the risks posed by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) on surfaces requires data on survival of this virus on environmental surfaces and on how survival is affected by environmental variables, such as air temperature (AT) and relative humidity (RH). The use of surrogate viruses has the potential to overcome the challenges of working with SARS-CoV and to increase the available data on coronavirus survival on surfaces. Two potential surrogates were evaluated in this study; transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) were used to determine effects of AT and RH on the survival of coronaviruses on stainless steel. At 4°C, infectious virus persisted for as long as 28 days, and the lowest level of inactivation occurred at 20% RH. Inactivation was more rapid at 20°C than at 4°C at all humidity levels; the viruses persisted for 5 to 28 days, and the slowest inactivation occurred at low RH. Both viruses were inactivated more rapidly at 40°C than at 20°C. The relationship between inactivation and RH was not monotonic, and there was greater survival or a greater protective effect at low RH (20%) and high RH (80%) than at moderate RH (50%). There was also evidence of an interaction between AT and RH. The results show that when high numbers of viruses are deposited, TGEV and MHV may survive for days on surfaces at ATs and RHs typical of indoor environments. TGEV and MHV could serve as conservative surrogates for modeling exposure, the risk of transmission, and control measures for pathogenic enveloped viruses, such as SARS-CoV and influenza virus, on health care surfaces.\n",

      "Abstract:  With a large number of COVID-19 patients discharging from hospital, some had showed re-fever and positive nucleic acid test after discharge from hospital. This might be due to the biological characteristics of 2019-nCoV, and might also be related to the basic disease, clinical status, glucocorticoid using, sample sampling, processing and detecting of patients, and some even related to the re-infection or secondary bacterial virus infection. Therefore, we suggest that in view of this phenomenon, further stratified management of discharge from hospital should be carried out on the basis of guidelines, especially for patients with advanced age, underlying diseases or severe or critical pneumonia. For those patients who can't completely deoxygenate for a long time after hospitalization, individualized treatment methods and different discharge evaluation criteria should be adopted to ensure the complete cure of patients and prevent recurrencing after discharge from hospital. 随着新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）患者大量出院，部分患者出院后出现再次发热、核酸检测阳性的现象。这可能是由于新型冠状病毒（2019-nCo V）的生物学特性所决定的，也可能与患者的基础疾病、临床状况、糖皮质激素的使用以及标本采样、处理、检测有关，甚至还与部分患者再次感染或继发其他细菌 病毒感染有关。为此，我们建议针对这一现象，应在指南基础上进一步对患者出院进行分层管理，尤其是高龄、有基础疾病或重症及危重型患者可能要进行相应处理 措施，对于患者住院后长期吸氧难以完全脱氧者采用个体化的处理方式和不同出院评估标准，旨在保证彻底治愈患者，防止出院后\"复发\"。.\n",

      "Abstract:  We report the development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) nucleocapsid protein. The assay was carried out with hyperimmune polyclonal nucleocapsid-specific antibodies from guinea pigs and rabbits immunized with recombinant His(6)-tagged SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein. The assay was used for the detection of SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein in nasopharyngeal aspirate, urine, and fecal samples collected from patients with confirmed SARS between days 2 and 33 after the onset of illness. The ELISA was capable of detecting this protein in SARS CoV cell culture lysates at 15 50% tissue culture infective doses/ml but did not produce positive signals when tested with cell culture lysates of human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E. When tested with 120 nasopharyngeal aspirate, 100 urine, and 100 fecal specimens from hospitalized patients without SARS, the assay was shown to have high specificities—96.7, 99, and 96%, respectively. In an evaluation of clinical specimens from SARS patients, 34 (52%) of 66 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from 50 patients, 5 (5%) of 94 urine samples from 94 patients, and 36 (55%) of 65 fecal samples from 65 patients tested positive for SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein. Nucleocapsid protein could be detected from days 6 to 24 in nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens, from days 11 to 31 in urine specimens, and from days 8 to 32 in fecal specimens after the onset of illness. Moreover, the protein could be detected in 25 (83%) of 30 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens obtained from days 11 to 15 and in all 7 fecal specimens obtained from days 21 to 32. Since the present ELISA is more convenient and economical than reverse transcription-PCR, it may serve as an alternative tool for the early diagnosis of SARS CoV infection in laboratories with limited resources and expertise and for mass screening for the reservoir of SARS CoV. Further studies on serial clinical specimens should reveal the duration of nucleocapsid protein shedding and may reveal a higher detection rate in SARS patients.\n",

Aims: To review the sputum cytology of 15 patients who fulfilled the World Health Organisation clinical criteria for SARS in an attempt to evaluate whether early diagnosis is feasible with routine sputum examination. Methods: All sputum samples from patients with SARS from the four major hospitals in Hong Kong were reviewed; abnormalities were sought in the cellular component, including abnormal numbers and morphology of the component cells compared with those from age matched controls taken over the same period one year ago. Results: Fifteen sputum samples from patients were compared with 25 control samples. In the patients with SARS, loose aggregates of macrophages were seen more frequently in the sputum. These macrophages frequently showed morphological changes, such as cytoplasmic foaminess, vacuole formation, and nuclear changes (including multinucleation and a ground glass appearance) when compared with the control samples. Conclusions: The cytological features of SARS are non-specific, but the observation of any of the described features should prompt further investigations, especially in patients with suspicious clinical features.\n",

      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) of sputum samples is commonly used to diagnose Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Owing to the difficulty of extracting RNA from sputum containing mucus, sputum homogenization is desirable prior to nucleic acid isolation. We determined optimal homogenization methods for isolating viral nucleic acids from sputum. METHODS: We evaluated the following three sputum-homogenization methods: proteinase K and DNase I (PK-DNase) treatment, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) treatment, and N-acetyl-L-cysteine and sodium citrate (NALC) treatment. Sputum samples were spiked with inactivated MERS-CoV culture isolates. RNA was extracted from pretreated, spiked samples using the easyMAG system (bioMérieux, France). Extracted RNAs were then subjected to rRT-PCR for MERS-CoV diagnosis (DiaPlex Q MERS-coronavirus, SolGent, Korea). RESULTS: While analyzing 15 spiked sputum samples prepared in technical duplicate, false-negative results were obtained with five (16.7%) and four samples (13.3%), respectively, by using the PBS and NALC methods. The range of threshold cycle (Ct) values observed when detecting upE in sputum samples was 31.1–35.4 with the PK-DNase method, 34.7–39.0 with the PBS method, and 33.9–38.6 with the NALC method. Compared with the control, which were prepared by adding a one-tenth volume of 1:1,000 diluted viral culture to PBS solution, the ranges of Ct values obtained by the PBS and NALC methods differed significantly from the mean control Ct of 33.2 (both P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The PK-DNase method is suitable for homogenizing sputum samples prior to RNA extraction.\n",

      "Title:  Human Coronavirus 229E Remains Infectious on Common Touch Surface Materials\n",
      "Abstract:  The evolution of new and reemerging historic virulent strains of respiratory viruses from animal reservoirs is a significant threat to human health. Inefficient human-to-human transmission of zoonotic strains may initially limit the spread of transmission, but an infection may be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces. Enveloped viruses are often susceptible to environmental stresses, but the human coronaviruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have recently caused increasing concern of contact transmission during outbreaks. We report here that pathogenic human coronavirus 229E remained infectious in a human lung cell culture model following at least 5 days of persistence on a range of common nonbiocidal surface materials, including polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon; PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, silicone rubber, and stainless steel. We have shown previously that noroviruses are destroyed on copper alloy surfaces. In this new study, human coronavirus 229E was rapidly inactivated on a range of copper alloys (within a few minutes for simulated fingertip contamination) and Cu/Zn brasses were very effective at lower copper concentration. Exposure to copper destroyed the viral genomes and irreversibly affected virus morphology, including disintegration of envelope and dispersal of surface spikes. Cu(I) and Cu(II) moieties were responsible for the inactivation, which was enhanced by reactive oxygen species generation on alloy surfaces, resulting in even faster inactivation than was seen with nonenveloped viruses on copper. Consequently, copper alloy surfaces could be employed in communal areas and at any mass gatherings to help reduce transmission of respiratory viruses from contaminated surfaces and protect the public health.\n",

      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Inanimate surfaces have often been described as the source for outbreaks of nosocomial infections. The aim of this review is to summarize data on the persistence of different nosocomial pathogens on inanimate surfaces. METHODS: The literature was systematically reviewed in MedLine without language restrictions. In addition, cited articles in a report were assessed and standard textbooks on the topic were reviewed. All reports with experimental evidence on the duration of persistence of a nosocomial pathogen on any type of surface were included. RESULTS: Most gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. (including VRE), Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), or Streptococcus pyogenes, survive for months on dry surfaces. Many gram-negative species, such as Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, or Shigella spp., can also survive for months. A few others, such as Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus vulgaris, or Vibrio cholerae, however, persist only for days. Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and spore-forming bacteria, including Clostridium difficile, can also survive for months on surfaces. Candida albicans as the most important nosocomial fungal pathogen can survive up to 4 months on surfaces. Persistence of other yeasts, such as Torulopsis glabrata, was described to be similar (5 months) or shorter (Candida parapsilosis, 14 days). Most viruses from the respiratory tract, such as corona, coxsackie, influenza, SARS or rhino virus, can persist on surfaces for a few days. Viruses from the gastrointestinal tract, such as astrovirus, HAV, polio- or rota virus, persist for approximately 2 months. Blood-borne viruses, such as HBV or HIV, can persist for more than one week. Herpes viruses, such as CMV or HSV type 1 and 2, have been shown to persist from only a few hours up to 7 days. CONCLUSION: The most common nosocomial pathogens may well survive or persist on surfaces for months and can thereby be a continuous source of transmission if no regular preventive surface disinfection is performed.\n",

      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: International and national travelling has made the rapid spread of infectious diseases possible. Little information is available on the role of major traffic hubs, such as airports, in the transmission of respiratory infections, including seasonal influenza and a pandemic threat. We investigated the presence of respiratory viruses in the passenger environment of a major airport in order to identify risk points and guide measures to minimize transmission. METHODS: Surface and air samples were collected weekly at three different time points during the peak period of seasonal influenza in 2015–16 in Finland. Swabs from surface samples, and air samples were tested by real-time PCR for influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus and coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43). RESULTS: Nucleic acid of at least one respiratory virus was detected in 9 out of 90 (10%) surface samples, including: a plastic toy dog in the children’s playground (2/3 swabs, 67%); hand-carried luggage trays at the security check area (4/8, 50%); the buttons of the payment terminal at the pharmacy (1/2, 50%); the handrails of stairs (1/7, 14%); and the passenger side desk and divider glass at a passport control point (1/3, 33%). Among the 10 respiratory virus findings at various sites, the viruses identified were: rhinovirus (4/10, 40%, from surfaces); coronavirus (3/10, 30%, from surfaces); adenovirus (2/10, 20%, 1 air sample, 1 surface sample); influenza A (1/10, 10%, surface sample). CONCLUSIONS: Detection of pathogen viral nucleic acids indicates respiratory viral surface contamination at multiple sites associated with high touch rates, and suggests a potential risk in the identified airport sites. Of the surfaces tested, plastic security screening trays appeared to pose the highest potential risk, and handling these is almost inevitable for all embarking passengers.\n",

      "Abstract:  Summary Currently, the emergence of a novel human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described with incubation times between 2-10 days, facilitating its spread via droplets, contaminated hands or surfaces. We therefore reviewed the literature on all available information about the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces as well as inactivation strategies with biocidal agents used for chemical disinfection, e.g. in healthcare facilities. The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective. As no specific therapies are available for SARS-CoV-2, early containment and prevention of further spread will be crucial to stop the ongoing outbreak and to control this novel infectious thread.\n",

      "Abstract:  Summary The novel human coronavirus 2019-nCoV has become a global health concern causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Human-to-human transmissions have been described, probably via droplets but possibly also via contaminated hands or surfaces. In a recent review on the persistence of human and veterinary coronaviruses on inanimate surfaces it was shown that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days. Some disinfectant agents effectively reduce coronavirus infectivity within 1 minute such 62% - 71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite. Other compounds such as 0.05% - 0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective.

      "Abstract:  The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presents an ideal example for developing One Health concepts. Dromedary camels are the principal reservoir for the virus. Infected camels shed the virus in body secretions, particularly nasal discharges. MERS-CoV has the potential to remain active in the environment for some time under optimum conditions of temperature and humidity. This shedding sustains the virus in endemic communities and thus contact with camels is considered a major risk factor for human infection. Reducing virus shedding from camels will have a great positive impact on reducing the human risk of infection. Our main objective is to highlight the potential aspects of reducing virus shedding from camels to the environment, thereby reducing the possibility of human infection. We will focus on the potential roles of camel markets, camel shows, importation, transportation and grazing in the amplification and shedding of the virus, providing some novel concepts for the control approaches for the MERS-CoV.\n",

      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: Recent data suggest that human coronavirus (HCoV) pneumonia is associated with significant mortality in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Investigation of risk factors for prolonged shedding and intrahost genome evolution may provide critical information for development of novel therapeutics. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed HCT recipients with HCoV detected in nasal samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HCoV strains were identified using strain-specific PCR. Shedding duration was defined as time between first positive and first negative sample. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate factors for prolonged shedding (≥21 days). Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was conducted when ≥4 samples with cycle threshold values of <28 were available. RESULTS: Seventeen of 44 patients had prolonged shedding. Among 31 available samples, 35% were OC43, 32% were NL63, 19% were HKU1, and 13% were 229E; median shedding duration was similar between strains (P = .79). Bivariable logistic regression analyses suggested that high viral load, receipt of high-dose steroids, and myeloablative conditioning were associated with prolonged shedding. mNGS among 5 subjects showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms from OC43 and NL63 starting 1 month following onset of shedding. CONCLUSIONS: High viral load, high-dose steroids, and myeloablative conditioning were associated with prolonged shedding of HCoV in HCT recipients. Genome changes were consistent with the expected molecular clock of HCoV.\n",

This review focuses on all important steps every veterinary practitioner has to deal with and new diagnostic tests that can be considered when encountering a cat with suspected FIP with the aim to establish a definitive diagnosis. It gives an overview on all available direct and indirect diagnostic tests and their sensitivity and specificity reported in the literature in different sample material. By providing summarized data for sensitivity and specificity of each diagnostic test and each sample material, which can easily be accessed in tables, this review can help to facilitate the interpretation of different diagnostic tests and raise awareness of their advantages and limitations. Additionally, diagnostic trees depict recommended diagnostic steps that should be performed in cats suspected of having FIP based on their clinical signs or clinicopathologic abnormalities. These steps can easily be followed in clinical practice.\n",

      "Abstract:  Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been studied for over 60 years, but have only recently gained notoriety as deadly human pathogens with the emergence of severe respiratory syndrome CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus. The rapid emergence of these viruses has demonstrated the need for good models to study severe CoV respiratory infection and pathogenesis. There are, currently, different methods and models for the study of CoV disease. The available genetic methods for the study and evaluation of CoV genetics are reviewed here. There are several animal models, both mouse and alternative animals, for the study of severe CoV respiratory disease that have been examined, each with different pros and cons relative to the actual pathogenesis of the disease in humans. A current limitation of these models is that no animal model perfectly recapitulates the disease seen in humans. Through the review and analysis of the available disease models, investigators can employ the most appropriate available model to study various aspects of CoV pathogenesis and evaluate possible antiviral treatments that may potentially be successful in future treatment and prevention of severe CoV respiratory infections.\n",

      "Abstract:  The availability of a robust disease model is essential for the development of countermeasures for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). While a rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV has been established, the lack of uniform, severe disease in this model complicates the analysis of countermeasure studies. Modeling of the interaction between the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein and its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 predicted comparable interaction energies in common marmosets and humans. The suitability of the marmoset as a MERS-CoV model was tested by inoculation via combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular routes. Most of the marmosets developed a progressive severe pneumonia leading to euthanasia of some animals. Extensive lesions were evident in the lungs of all animals necropsied at different time points post inoculation. Some animals were also viremic; high viral loads were detected in the lungs of all infected animals, and total RNAseq demonstrated the induction of immune and inflammatory pathways. This is the first description of a severe, partially lethal, disease model of MERS-CoV, and as such will have a major impact on the ability to assess the efficacy of vaccines and treatment strategies as well as allowing more detailed pathogenesis studies.\n",

      "Abstract:  The emergence and reemergence of coronavirus epidemics sparked renewed concerns from global epidemiology researchers and public health administrators. Mathematical models that represented how contact tracing and follow-up may control Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) transmissions were developed for evaluating different infection control interventions, estimating likely number of infections as well as facilitating understanding of their likely epidemiology. We reviewed mathematical models for contact tracing and follow-up control measures of SARS and MERS transmission. Model characteristics, epidemiological parameters and intervention parameters used in the mathematical models from seven studies were summarized. A major concern identified in future epidemics is whether public health administrators can collect all the required data for building epidemiological models in a short period of time during the early phase of an outbreak. Also, currently available models do not explicitly model constrained resources. We urge for closed-loop communication between public health administrators and modelling researchers to come up with guidelines to delineate the collection of the required data in the midst of an outbreak and the inclusion of additional logistical details in future similar models.\n",

      "Abstract:  Exotic and emerging viral pathogens associated with high morbidity and mortality in humans are being identified annually with recent examples including Lujo virus in southern Africa, Severe fever with Thrombocytopenia virus in China and a SARS-like coronavirus in the Middle East. The sporadic nature of these infections hampers our understanding of these diseases and limits the opportunities to design appropriate medical countermeasures against them. Due to this, animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines. For these reasons it is imperative that animal models of disease recapitulate the human condition as closely as possible in order to provide the best predictive data with respect to the potential efficacy in humans. In this article we review the current status of disease models for highly pathogenic and emerging viral pathogens.\n",

      "Abstract:  Infection of conventional mice with a mouse adapted (MA15) severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) reproduces many aspects of human SARS such as pathological changes in lung, viremia, neutrophilia, and lethality. However, established mouse cell lines highly susceptible to mouse-adapted SARS-CoV infection are not available. In this work, efficiently transfectable mouse cell lines stably expressing the murine SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) have been generated. These cells yielded high SARS-CoV-MA15 titers and also served as excellent tools for plaque assays. In addition, in these cell lines, SARS-CoV-MA15 induced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and IFN-β, mimicking what has been observed in experimental animal models infected with SARS-CoV and SARS patients. These cell lines are valuable tools to perform in vitro studies in a mouse cell system that reflects the species used for in vivo studies of SARS-CoV-MA15 pathogenesis.\n",

      "Abstract:  SUMMARY: Genome Detective is a web-based, user-friendly software application to quickly and accurately assemble all known virus genomes from next generation sequencing datasets. This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. Since its release in 2019, we have produced a number of typing tools for emergent viruses that have caused large outbreaks, such as Zika and Yellow Fever Virus in Brazil. Here, we present The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool that can accurately identify the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) sequences isolated in China and around the world. The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. The tool has been tested and validated with hundreds of whole genomes from ten coronavirus species, and correctly classified all of the SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and all of the available public data for SARS-CoV-2. The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to stop the COVID-19 disease.

      "Title:  Innate Immune Evasion by Human Respiratory RNA Viruses\n",
      "Abstract:  The impact of respiratory virus infections on the health of children and adults can be very significant. Yet, in contrast to most other childhood infections as well as other viral and bacterial diseases, prophylactic vaccines or effective antiviral treatments against viral respiratory infections are either still not available, or provide only limited protection. Given the widespread prevalence, a general lack of natural sterilizing immunity, and/or high morbidity and lethality rates of diseases caused by influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, coronaviruses, and rhinoviruses, this difficult situation is a genuine societal challenge. A thorough understanding of the virus-host interactions during these respiratory infections will most probably be pivotal to ultimately meet these challenges. This review attempts to provide a comparative overview of the knowledge about an important part of the interaction between respiratory viruses and their host: the arms race between host innate immunity and viral innate immune evasion. Many, if not all, viruses, including the respiratory viruses listed above, suppress innate immune responses to gain a window of opportunity for efficient virus replication and setting-up of the infection. The consequences for the host's immune response are that it is often incomplete, delayed or diminished, or displays overly strong induction (after the delay) that may cause tissue damage. The affected innate immune response also impacts subsequent adaptive responses, and therefore viral innate immune evasion often undermines fully protective immunity. In this review, innate immune responses relevant for respiratory viruses with an RNA genome will briefly be summarized, and viral innate immune evasion based on shielding viral RNA species away from cellular innate immune sensors will be discussed from different angles. Subsequently, viral enzymatic activities that suppress innate immune responses will be discussed, including activities causing host shut-off and manipulation of stress granule formation. Furthermore, viral protease-mediated immune evasion and viral manipulation of the ubiquitin system will be addressed. Finally, perspectives for use of the reviewed knowledge for the development of novel antiviral strategies will be sketched.\n",

These viruses have evolved diverse strategies to evade and block host immune responses, facilitating infection and transmission. Pathogenesis following infection with these viruses is characterized by a marked delay in the induction of Type I interferon (IFN I) and, subsequently, by a poor adaptive immune response. Therapies that expedite IFN I induction as well as interventions that antagonize immunoevasive virus proteins are thus promising candidates for immune modulation.\n",

However, little information about the targets of immune responses to 2019-nCoV is available. We used the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) resource to catalog available data related to other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, which has high sequence similarity to 2019-nCoV, and is the best-characterized coronavirus in terms of epitope responses. We identified multiple specific regions in 2019-nCoV that have high homology to SARS virus. Parallel bionformatic predictions identified a priori potential B and T cell epitopes for 2019-nCoV. The independent identification of the same regions using two approaches reflects the high probability that these regions are targets for immune recognition of 2019-nCoV.\n",

      "Abstract:  Although the initial isolates of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) are sensitive to neutralization by antibodies through their spike (S) glycoprotein, variants of S have since been identified that are resistant to such inhibition. Optimal vaccine strategies would therefore make use of additional determinants of immune recognition, either through cellular or expanded, cross-reactive humoral immunity. Here, the cellular and humoral immune responses elicited by different combinations of gene-based and inactivated viral particles with various adjuvants have been assessed. The T-cell response was altered by different prime-boost immunizations, with the optimal CD8 immunity induced by DNA priming and replication-defective adenoviral vector boosting. The humoral immune response was enhanced most effectively through the use of inactivated virus with adjuvants, either MF59 or alum, and was associated with stimulation of the CD4 but not the CD8 response. The use of inactivated SARS virus with MF59 enhanced the CD4 and antibody response even after gene-based vaccination. Because both cellular and humoral immune responses are generated by gene-based vaccination and inactivated viral boosting, this strategy may prove useful in the generation of SARS-CoV vaccines.\n",

      "Abstract:  Positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses comprise many (re-)emerging human pathogens that pose a public health problem. Our innate immune system and, in particular, the interferon response form the important first line of defence against these viruses. Given their genetic flexibility, these viruses have therefore developed multiple strategies to evade the innate immune response in order to optimize their replication capacity. Already many molecular mechanisms of innate immune evasion by +ssRNA viruses have been identified. However, research addressing the effect of host innate immune evasion on the pathology caused by viral infections is less prevalent in the literature, though very relevant and interesting. Since interferons have been implicated in inflammatory diseases and immunopathology in addition to their protective role in infection, antagonizing the immune response may have an ambiguous effect on the clinical outcome of the viral disease. Therefore, this review discusses what is currently known about the role of interferons and host immune evasion in the pathogenesis of emerging coronaviruses, alphaviruses and flaviviruses.\n",

      "Abstract:  The outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused 209 deaths and 699 laboratory-confirmed cases in the Arabian Peninsula as of June 11, 2014. Preparedness efforts are hampered by considerable uncertainty about the nature and intensity of human-to-human transmission, with previous reproduction number estimates ranging from 0.4 to 1.5. Here we synthesize epidemiological data and transmission models for the MERS-CoV outbreak during April-October 2013 to resolve uncertainties in epidemic risk, while considering the impact of observation bias. We match the progression of MERS-CoV cases in 2013 to a dynamic transmission model that incorporates community and hospital compartments, and distinguishes transmission by zoonotic (index) cases and secondary cases. When observation bias is assumed to account for the fact that all reported zoonotic cases are severe, but only ~57% of secondary cases are symptomatic, the average reproduction number of MERS-CoV is estimated to be 0.45 (95%CI:0.29–0.61). Alternatively, if these epidemiological observations are taken at face value, index cases are estimated to transmit substantially more effectively than secondary cases, (R(i) =0.84 (0.58–1.20) vs R(s)=0.36 (0.24–0.51)). In both scenarios the relative contribution of hospital-based transmission is over four times higher than that of community transmission, indicating that disease control should be focused on hospitalized patients. Adjusting previously published estimates for observation bias confirms a strong support for the average R < 1 in the first stage of the outbreak in 2013 and thus, transmissibility of secondary cases of MERS-CoV remained well below the epidemic threshold. More information on the observation process is needed to clarify whether MERS-CoV is intrinsically weakly transmissible between people or whether existing control measures have contributed meaningfully to reducing the transmissibility of secondary cases. Our results could help evaluate the progression of MERS-CoV in recent months in response to changes in disease surveillance, control interventions, or viral adaptation.\n",

In this cohort, the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious case was 0·2. Two community contacts with laboratory evidence of SARS coronavirus infection had mild or sub-clinical infection, representing 3% (2/65) of Vietnamese SARS cases. There was no evidence of transmission of infection before symptom onset.

RESULTS: Children were selected via convenience sampling from communities and a tertiary care center (n = 91) during spring 2017 in Ilorin, Nigeria. Nasal swabs were collected and tested using polymerase chain reaction. The majority (79.1%) of subjects were under 6 years old, of whom 46 were infected (63.9%). A total of 33 of the 91 subjects had one or more respiratory tract virus; there were 10 cases of triple infection and 5 of quadruple. Parainfluenza virus 4, respiratory syncytial virus B and enterovirus were the most common viruses in the clinical sample; present in 93.8% (15/16) of clinical subjects, and 6.7% (5/75) of community subjects (significant difference, p < 0.001). Coronavirus OC43 was the most common virus detected in community members (13.3%, 10/75). A different strain, Coronavirus OC 229 E/NL63 was detected among subjects from the clinic (2/16) and not detected in the community. This pilot study provides evidence that data from the community can potentially represent different information than that sourced clinically, suggesting the need for community surveillance to enhance public health efforts and scientific understanding of respiratory infections.\n",

      "Abstract:  Background: Personal protective equipment (PPE) is a primary strategy to protect health care personnel (HCP) from infectious diseases. When transmission-based PPE ensembles are not appropriate, HCP must recognize the transmission pathway of the disease and anticipate the exposures to select PPE. Because guidance for this process is extremely limited, we proposed a systematic, risk-based approach to the selection and evaluation of PPE ensembles to protect HCP against infectious diseases. Methods: The approach used in this study included the following 4 steps: (1) job hazard analysis, (2) infectious disease hazard analysis, (3) selection of PPE, and (4) evaluation of selected PPE. Selected PPE should protect HCP from exposure, be usable by HCP, and fit for purpose. Results: The approach was demonstrated for the activity of intubation of a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. As expected, the approach led to the selection of different ensembles of PPE for these 2 pathogens. Discussion: A systematic risk-based approach to the selection of PPE will help health care facilities and HCP select PPE when transmission-based precautions are not appropriate. Owing to the complexity of PPE ensemble selection and evaluation, a team with expertise in infectious diseases, occupational health, the health care activity, and related disciplines, such as human factors, should be engaged. Conclusions: Participation, documentation, and transparency are necessary to ensure the decisions can be communicated, critiqued, and understood by HCP.

There is currently no consensus for the types of PPE that are recommended to be worn by HCWs, nor is there a universal process for the donning and doffing of PPE. METHODS: HCWs from Bellevue Hospital participate in quarterly PPE trainings as part of the Special Pathogens Program (SPP), which consist of didactic sessions as well as an evaluation of donning and doffing techniques. A total of 50 HCWs completed the training curriculum in 2017. During the doffing process, PPE trainers applied corn start powder paint (Chameleon Colors; American Fork, UT) to the participants’ gloved hands between multiple steps of PPE removal. At the end of the process, the areas where paint was found on was documented including the outer surgical gown, the powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) helmet and shroud, the inner impermeable suit, the knee-high boots and boot covers, and the extended-cuff gloves. RESULTS: The areas of PPE that were most marked with paint were the lower shoulders and upper arms of the surgical gowns, the top sides of the PAPR shroud, the front upper chest area, and the center back of the inner impermeable suits. In a majority of cases no powder paint was noted on the knee-high boots. In a minority of cases, paint was observed on the inside upper chest area of the surgical gown. These paint markings were used to discuss potential breaches in PPE doffing technique in real-time, as well as identify areas to target in future PPE trainings. CONCLUSION: The powdered paint quality improvement process for donning and doffing PPE is a method to evaluate the complex PPE dressing procedure. It is particularly useful given the fact that it is incumbent on each hospital or healthcare system to develop its own processes and procedures for PPE, as well as maintain readiness through periodic trainings. Powdered paint can identify vulnerabilities in their process as well as areas that require further education. DISCLOSURES: All authors: No reported disclosures.\n",

      "Abstract:  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and represents the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. Based on the large number of infected people that were exposed to the wet animal market in Wuhan City, China, it is suggested that this is likely the zoonotic origin of COVID-19. Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. In this review, we highlights the symptoms, epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, phylogenetic analysis and future directions to control the spread of this fatal disease.\n",

      "Title:  Evaluation of a Redesigned Personal Protective Equipment Gown\n",
      "Abstract:  BACKGROUND: In healthcare, the goal of personal protective equipment (PPE) is to protect healthcare personnel (HCP) and patients from body fluids and infectious organisms via contact, droplet, or airborne transmission. The critical importance of using PPE properly is highlighted by 2 potentially fatal viral infections, severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus and Ebola virus, where HCP became infected while caring for patients due to errors in the use of PPE. However, PPE in dealing with less dangerous, but highly infectious organisms is important as well. This work proposes a framework to test and evaluate PPE with a focus on gown design. METHODS: An observational study identified issues with potential for contamination related to gown use. After redesigning the existing gown, a high-fidelity patient simulator study with 40 HCP as participants evaluated the gown redesign using 2 commonly performed tasks. Variables of interest were nonadherence to procedural standards, use problems with the gown during task performance, and usability and cognitive task load ratings of the standard and redesigned gowns. RESULTS: While no differences were found in terms of nonadherence and use problems between the current and the redesigned gown, differences in usability and task load ratings suggested that the redesigned gown is perceived more favorably by HCP. CONCLUSIONS: This work proposes a framework to guide the evaluation of PPE. The results suggest that the current design of the PPE gown can be improved in usability and user satisfaction. Although our data did not find an increase in adherence to protocol when using the redesigned gown, it is likely that higher usability and lower task load could result in higher adherence over longer periods of use.\n",

      "Title:  Taking the right measures to control COVID-19\n",
      "Abstract:  First, although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. The widespread practice of spraying disinfectant and alcohol in the sky, on roads, vehicles, and personnel has no value; moreover, large quantities of alcohol and disinfectant are potentially harmful to humans and should be avoided.3 , 4 Second, in the use of personal protective equipment, we should try to distinguish different risk factors, adopt different epidemic prevention measures, and reduce the waste of personal protective equipment, as these resources are already in short supply. Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals where health-care workers are in direct contact with infected patients.5 Third, the practice of blocking traffic and lockdown of villages is of no value for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have suspended flights to and from China, and prevented Chinese people from travelling to their countries; both of these actions violate WHO International Health Regulations.6 Similarly, in community prevention and control of the disease, the measures taken by individual villages and communities to seal off roads are of no value.7 Such measures could result in civil unrest and reduce compliance with infection prevention and control advice. Fourth, public health education must be based on scientific evidence to reduce the anxiety and distress caused by misinformation. In particular, epidemiological findings need to be reported in a timely and objective manner so that they can be accurately assessed and interpreted. The risk of transmission with brief contact (less than 15 min face-to-face contact) or infection onset after 14 days of exposure to a known infected person (the estimated maximum incubation period) is low and should not be over-exaggerated. Misinformation spreads panic among the general population and is not conducive to implementation of epidemic control measures.8 Fifth, WHO has made it clear that there are currently no known effective treatments for COVID-19 and does not recommend the use of antiviral drugs, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, or traditional Chinese medicine. Despite this, there have been reports of the use of oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, prednisone, antibiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.9 Care should be taken to not give patients drugs of unknown efficacy, which might be detrimental to critically ill patients with COVID-19; clinical trials are urgently required in this context.10 Likewise, the development of a vaccine is an urgent public health priority.\n",

      "Abstract:  The main route of transmission of SARS CoV infection is presumed to be respiratory droplets. However the virus is also detectable in other body fluids and excreta. The stability of the virus at different temperatures and relative humidity on smooth surfaces were studied. The dried virus on smooth surfaces retained its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22–25°C and relative humidity of 40–50%, that is, typical air-conditioned environments. However, virus viability was rapidly lost (>3 log(10)) at higher temperatures and higher relative humidity (e.g., 38°C, and relative humidity of >95%). The better stability of SARS coronavirus at low temperature and low humidity environment may facilitate its transmission in community in subtropical area (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned environments. It may also explain why some Asian countries in tropical area (such as Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand) with high temperature and high relative humidity environment did not have major community outbreaks of SARS.\n",

      "Title:  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and the One Health concept\n",
      "Abstract:  Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is one of the major threats to the healthcare systems in some countries, especially in the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV is considered an ideal example of the One Health concept. This is due to the animals, especially dromedary camels, play important roles in the transmission and sustainability of the virus, and the virus can be transmitted through aerosols of infected patients into the environment. However, there is some debate regarding the origin of MERS-CoV either from bats or other unknown reservoirs. The dromedary camel is the only identified animal reservoir to date. These animals play important roles in sustaining the virus in certain communities and may act as an amplifier of the virus by secreting it in their body fluids, especially in nasal and rectal discharges. MERS-CoV has been detected in the nasal and rectal secretions of infected camels, and MERS-CoV of this origin has full capacity to infect human airway epithelium in both in vitro and in vivo models. Other evidence confirms the direct transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans, though the role of camel meat and milk products has yet to be well studied. Human-to-human transmission is well documented through contact with an active infected patient or some silently infected persons. Furthermore, there are some significant risk factors of individuals in close contact with a positive MERS-CoV patient, including sleeping in the same patient room, removing patient waste (urine, stool, and sputum), and touching respiratory secretions from the index case. Outbreaks within family clusters have been reported, whereby some blood relative patients were infected through their wives in the same house were not infected. Some predisposing genetic factors favor MERS-CoV infection in some patients, which is worth investigating in the near future. The presence of other comorbidities may be another factor. Overall, there are many unknown/confirmed aspects of the virus/human/animal network. Here, the most recent advances in this context are discussed, and the possible reasons behind the emergence and sustainability of MERS-CoV in certain regions are presented. Identification of the exact mechanism of transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans and searching for new reservoir/s are of high priority. This will reduce the shedding of the virus into the environment, and thus the risk of human infection can be mitigated.\n",

      "Abstract:  The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) presents an ideal example for developing One Health concepts. Dromedary camels are the principal reservoir for the virus. Infected camels shed the virus in body secretions, particularly nasal discharges. MERS-CoV has the potential to remain active in the environment for some time under optimum conditions of temperature and humidity. This shedding sustains the virus in endemic communities and thus contact with camels is considered a major risk factor for human infection. Reducing virus shedding from camels will have a great positive impact on reducing the human risk of infection. Our main objective is to highlight the potential aspects of reducing virus shedding from camels to the environment, thereby reducing the possibility of human infection. We will focus on the potential roles of camel markets, camel shows, importation, transportation and grazing in the amplification and shedding of the virus, providing some novel concepts for the control approaches for the MERS-CoV.\n",

    "#### Task 1: What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?\n",
    "Controversy remains about whether COVID-19 has infectivity during the incubation period. A case was reported that did not show infectivity during the incubation period. Another clustering outbreak case suggested asymptomatic patients may be the key point to control the epidemic. A shorter incubation period of SARS-CoV may associate with more severe disease (PMC_ID: PMC4889459). A longer incubation period of MERS-CoV may associate with a lower risk of death (PMC_ID: PMC4766874). Longer recovery delay of MERS-CoV was seen in patients of older age, ICU admission, and abnormal radiology findings (PMC_ID: PMC6086845). Before 2012, CoV infection was found not associated with hospitalization or with increased severity of illness for children hospitalized for acute respiratory illness and/or fever (PMC_ID: PMC3288315). COVID-19 are usually mild in children while prolonged virus shedding is observed in the respiratory tract and feces at the convalescent stage. Before COVID-19, CoV generally displayed in winter seasonality between December and April, except HCoV-229E (PMC_ID: PMC2916580). Viruses other than influenza may also be important contributors to hospitalization and mortality during the peak weeks of influenza seasons, especially for the elderly (PMC_ID: PMC4281811). The role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV has been confirmed (PMC_ID: PMC6518552, PMC_ID: PMC6518552). Hospital-associated transmission may have a larger role than direct contact with an infected camel in the spread of MERS-CoV (PMC_ID: PMC6518552). Studies have described the ability of CoVs to survive in different environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and humidity), on different supports found in hospital settings such as aluminum, sterile sponges or latex surgical gloves or in biological fluids (PMC_ID: PMC3509683). Nasal discharge showed a higher viral positivity than feces for bovine CoV, which seemed to be associated with positive detection in the plasma (PMC_ID: PMC6068295). In an evaluation of clinical specimens from SARS patients, 34 (52%) of 66 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from 50 patients, 5 (5%) of 94 urine samples from 94 patients, and 36 (55%) of 65 fecal samples from 65 patients tested positive for SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein (PMC_ID: PMC446266). Pathogenic CoV-229E remained infectious in a human lung cell culture model following at least 5 days of persistence on a range of common nonbiocidal surface materials, including polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon; PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, silicone rubber, and stainless steel (PMC_ID: PMC4659470). CoV-229E was rapidly inactivated on a range of copper alloys (within a few minutes for simulated fingertip contamination) and Cu/Zn brasses were very effective at lower copper concentration. Exposure to copper destroyed the viral genomes and irreversibly affected virus morphology, including disintegration of envelope and dispersal of surface spikes (PMC_ID: PMC4659470). Most viruses from the respiratory tract, including SARS, can persist on surfaces for a few days (PMC_ID: PMC1564025). The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62–71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute. Alpacas may be suitable models for infection and shedding dynamics of MERS-CoV (PMC_ID: PMC4880109). Rhesus macaque and common marmoset have been established as animal models for MERS-CoV (PMC_ID: PMC4140844). A current limitation of animal models for CoV is that no animal model perfectly recapitulates the disease seen in humans (PMC_ID: PMC4811657). No evidence was found of changes in the evolutionary rate of MERS-CoV and no reason to suspect adaptive changes in viral proteins (PMC_ID: PMC4734539). Many, if not all, viruses, including CoV, suppress innate immune responses to gain a window of opportunity for efficient virus replication and setting-up of the infection (PMC_ID: PMC6959104). Potential targets have been identified for immune responses to COVID-19 and provide essential information for understanding human immune responses to this virus and evaluation of diagnostic and vaccine candidates. For SARS-CoV, the humoral immune response was enhanced most effectively through the use of inactivated virus with adjuvants, either MF59 or alum, and was associated with stimulation of the CD4 but not the CD8 response (PMC_ID: PMC1280202). MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have evolved diverse strategies to evade and block host immune responses, facilitating infection and transmission (PMC_ID: PMC4821769).  Full precautions should be applied and carefully followed to prevent the transmission of MERS-CoV, especially among health care workers (PMC_ID: PMC6695009). For SARS-CoV, a study reported that there was no evidence of transmission of infection before symptom onset (PMC_ID: PMC2870589). The patients treated in the burn and wound care ward are susceptible to viral infection because of disease, age and other factors, so it is very important to manage the burn and wound care ward during the prevention and control of CoV epidemic. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people. Contaminated surfaces may play a major role in transmission of SARS-CoV in the hospital and the community (PMC_ID: PMC3265313). The better stability of SARS-CoV at low temperature and low humidity environment may facilitate its transmission in community in subtropical area (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned environments (PMC_ID: PMC3265313). In countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong where there is an intensive use of air-conditioning, transmission of SARS-CoV largely occurred in well-air-conditioned environments such as hospitals or hotels (PMC_ID: PMC3265313)."

    "**Discussion**: It is still not 100% clear whether COVID-19 has infectivity during the incubation period or before symptom onset. Based on research with SRAS-CoV and MERS-CoV, a shorter incubation period often suggests a worse disease outcome. Elderly people tend to have more severe disease. CoV generally outbreaks during winter seasonality. The virus may survive on different types of solid surfaces for multiple days. CoV can be transmitted between humans and between humans and animals (e.g. between camels and humans for MERS-CoV)."

    "#### Task 2: What do we know about COVID-19 risk factors?\n",
    "Evidence of an impact of legislative bans on smoking prevalence and tobacco consumption is inconsistent, with some studies not detecting additional long‐term change in existing trends in smoking prevalence or impact on respiratory and perinatal health outcomes (PMC_ID: PMC6486282). Coronavirus infection should be considered in differential diagnosis of respiratory tract illness in adults including those that require hospitalization, have a history of smoking and have pulmonary comorbidities (PMC_ID: PMC5631947). Pulmonary function testing procedures have been associated with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission among patients/subjects and medical staffs. It is strongly recommended to suspend the pulmonary function test for the confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 during the contagious stage, and to postpone the test for other patients if it is not imperative. H1N1 patients coinfected with rhinovirus had less severe disease while non-rhinovirus co-infections were associated with substantially higher severity without changes in influenza viral titer (PMC_ID: PMC3153592). There was a significant decrease in the duration of influenza A viral shedding in co-infections (of any respiratory viruses) compared to single infections (PMC_ID: PMC6625191). Respiratory viruses rarely reach their epidemic peak concurrently and there appears to be a negative association between infection with one respiratory virus and co-infection with another (PMC_ID: PMC6625191). Co-detections of specific clusters of viruses were observed in 9% of acute respiratory illness cases particularly in children, were less frequent in households without children, and were less symptomatic (e.g., lower fever) than single infections (PMC_ID: PMC4344779). Most frequently co-detected viruses were coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza A virus (PMC_ID: PMC4344779). Co-infection was less likely with increasing age, which may be a consequence of pre-existing immunity or decreased viral shedding with increasing age (PMC_ID: PMC6625191). Infection by rhinovirus may result in temporary immunity of the host to infection by other respiratory viruses due to the production of cytokines, thus resulting in a negative association between rhinovirus infection and co-infection with another virus (PMC_ID: PMC6625191). So far, no maternal deaths have been reported for women with COVID-19. There appears to be some risk of premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, fetal tachycardia and fetal distress when the infection occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy. There is no evidence suggesting transplacental transmission based on very limited data, as the analysis of amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breast milk samples available from six of the nine patients were found to be negative for COVID-19. Whether virus shedding occurs vaginally is also not known. In general, the clinical characteristics of the pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Another study reported that the impact of COVID-19 infection on pregnant women appears to be less severe. Both SARS coronavirus and H7N9 viruses presented a global epidemic threat, but the social and economic impacts of H7N9 were not as serious as in the case of SARS because the response to H7N9 was more effective (PMC_ID: PMC6046118). A mathematical model for MERS-CoV transmission dynamics has been used to estimate the transmission rates in two periods due to the implementation of intensive interventions (PMC_ID: PMC4776270). The serial interval of COVID-19 is close to or shorter than its median incubation period. This suggests that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset. The COVID-19 serial interval is also shorter than the serial interval of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), indicating that calculations made using the SARS serial interval may introduce bias. Among patients infected with a respiratory virus, risk of hospitalization was higher among underweight adult patients, and obese patients had a longer mean length of stay once hospitalized (PMC_ID: PMC6809817). Underweight children were not at increased risk of hospitalization (PMC_ID: PMC6809817). For MERS-CoV, increased age and underlying comorbidity were risk factors for both death and severe disease, while cases arising in Saudi Arabia were more likely to be severe (PMC_ID: PMC5023790). There is no significant association between alleles or genotypes of the MASP2 tagSNP and susceptibility to SARS-CoV in both Beijing and Guangzhou populations (PMC_ID: PMC2683852). MASP2 polymorphisms is not directly related to SARS-CoV susceptibility in northern and southern Chinese (PMC_ID: PMC2683852). Strong infection control and response measures were effective in controlling the outbreak of MERS-CoV in the Republic of Korea (PMC_ID: PMC4957609). Two of the most effective policy procedures to prevent infections of SARS-CoV would be to apply stringent precautionary measures and to impose quicker and more effective quarantine of the exposed populace (PMC_ID: PMC1732706)."

    "#### Task 3: What do we know about virus genetics, origin, and evolution?\n",
    "A web-based tool (SummaryGenome Detective) was developed to allow tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to stop the COVID-19 disease. A web-based portal (WashU Virus Genome Browser) was developed for viewing virus genomic data, which is home to 16 complete 2019-nCoV genome sequences, together with hundreds of related viral sequences including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and Ebola virus. Genetic and epidemiological evidence indicate camels serve as a reservoir for MERS virus (PMC_ID: PMC4720378). The emergence of MERS-CoV was believed to be of zoonotic origin from bats with dromedary camels as intermediate hosts. There is a likelihood of other domestic livestock serving as intermediate hosts for this virus (PMC_ID: PMC6473935). RNA-RNA recombination may play a significant role in natural evolution and neuropathogenesis of coronaviruses (PMC_ID: PMC253235). It is unclear whether higher virus load causally leads to severe outcomes of MERS-CoV (PMC_ID: PMC4622256). Wildlife trade can facilitate zoonotic disease transmission and represents a threat to human health and economies in Asia, highlighted by the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak, where a Chinese wildlife market facilitated pathogen transmission (PMC_ID: PMC4805265). Highly pathogenic viruses elicit expression of many of the same key genes as lower pathogenic viruses but to a higher degree. This increased degree of expression may result in the uncontrolled co-localization of inflammatory cell types and lead to irreversible host damage (PMC_ID: PMC3297540). In addition to SARS, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (AIV), H5N1, and the lower pathogenicity H9N2 AIV have expanded their host ranges to infect human beings and other mammalian species as well as birds (PMC_ID: PMC2865088). Viruses that originate in bats may be the most notorious emerging zoonoses that spill over from wildlife into domestic animals and humans (PMC_ID: PMC4262174). Transmission of viruses from bats to humans requires a hierarchy of enabling conditions that connect the distribution of reservoir hosts, viral infection within these hosts, and exposure and susceptibility of recipient hosts (PMC_ID: PMC4262174). The advancements in metagenomic techniques have allowed the identification of SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) sequences that share high homology to the human SARS-CoV epidemic strains from wildlife bats, presenting concrete evidence that bats are the origin and natural reservoir of SARS-CoV (PMC_ID: PMC5287300). Demographic factors, such as race, smoking status, and socioeconomic status, may confer an increased risk of susceptibility to viruses including CoV (PMC_ID: PMC2593164)."

Less attention has been paid to the genetic and evolution of the virus after it was well-recognized as a SARS-like coronavirus. Therefore, most articles retrieved with the general terms like \"evolution\" and \"genetics\" are about research on earlier identified coronavirus like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV."

    "#### Task 4: What do we know about vaccines and therapeutics?\n",
    "Drugs developed for HIV and Ebola are being tested for treating COVID-19. In the epidemic of COVID-19, front-line medical staff in emergency traumatic orthopedics is faced with great challenges in the process of diagnosing and treating patients. Lung computed tomography images are being used for supporting the diagnosis of COVID-19. It is considered particularly important for medical institutions of all levels to maintain safe and effective routine services while doing well in COVID-19 prevention. Viral protease inhibitors are remarkably effective at blocking the replication of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus, but they inevitably lead to the selection of inhibitor-resistant mutants, which may contribute to ongoing disease (PMC_ID: PMC4178758). To date, effective treatment is lacking; however, clinical trials investigating the efficacy of several agents, including remdesivir and chloroquine, are underway in China for COVID-19. From the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (http://www.chictr.org.cn) and U.S. National Library of Medicine Clinical Trial Registry (https://clinicaltrials. gov), there are 125 clinical trials registered by February 18, 2020, focusing on the treatment of COVID-19. There is an upward trend on the number of registered clinical trials. Among the 125 clinical trials on treatment, 33.3% used anti-viral agents, 14.7% anti-inflammation or immunomodulators, 33.3% herbs or traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), 9.3% cell-based therapy, 2.3% antioxidation and 7.0% other approaches. Studies suggest that the human receptor for COVID-19 may be angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor similar to that of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of COVID-19 has nearly 90% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV. The N protein antibodies of SARS-CoV may cross react with COVID-19 but may not provide cross-immunity. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral entry has been a major concern for epidemiology, vaccine development, and antibody-based drug therapy. The discrepancy between the severity of cases observed in the Hubei province of China and those occurring elsewhere in the world may due to the antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 due to prior exposure to other coronaviruses. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), a phenomenon in which viral replication is increased rather than decreased by immune sera, has been observed in vitro for a large number of viruses of public health importance, including flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and retroviruses (PMC_ID: PMC1257724). Vaccination is a major strategy for containing resurgence of SARS in humans, and a number of vaccine candidates have been tested in experimental animal models (PMC_ID: PMC3187504). In general, the potential vaccine candidates for MERS-CoV can be classified into six types: viral vector-based vaccine, DNA vaccine, subunit vaccine, nanoparticle-based vaccine, inactivated-whole virus vaccine and live-attenuated vaccine (PMC_ID: PMC6688523). Animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines (PMC_ID: PMC3644300). MERS-CoV has been used to screen FDA-approved drugs identify potential therapeutic options for treatment of MERS-CoV infections and provide a basis for potential therapeutic options for COVID-19. COVID-19 imaging characteristic mainly has subpleural, centrilobular and diffused distribution. N protein can be used as an early diagnostic maker for SARS (PMC_ID: PMC3329003). Several types of vaccines have been developed for SARS-CoV including inactivated viruses, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), DNA vaccines, heterologous expression systems, and vaccines derived from SARS-CoV genome by reverse genetics (PMC_ID: PMC2633062). Transgenic mouse model has been developed for MERS-CoV (PMC_ID: PMC4403411). The standard small animals, mice, hamsters, and ferrets, all lack the functional MERS-CoV receptor and are not susceptible to infection (PMC_ID: PMC4403411). Camel vaccination for MERS-CoV may be a novel approach to preventing the human infection (PMC_ID: PMC4969153). For SARS-CoV, evaluations of an inactivated whole virus vaccine in ferrets and nonhuman primates and a virus-like-particle vaccine in mice induced protection against infection but challenged animals exhibited an immunopathologic-type lung disease (PMC_ID: PMC3335060). The majority of MERS vaccines under development are based on MERS-CoV S protein, including full-length S, S1, and receptor-binding domain (RBD). (PMC_ID: PMC6355461)."

Vaccine may be the most promising approach for preventing COVID-19 and other CoV diseases from a resurgence. Vaccine development strategy for SARS-CoV and MERS-COV can be valuable for guiding COVID-19 vaccine design. Antibody-dependent enhancement may be associated with the discrepancy of COVID-19 severity in different areas and may affect vaccine development. Drugs used for other virus-based diseases are also being tested for treating COVID-19."

    "#### Task 5: What has been published about medical care?\n",
    "While ensuring the completion of treatment work of COVID-19, Beijing You'an Hospital manage to leverage nursing human resources in a scientific, standardized and maximized efficiency manner, to ensure the quality of nursing, and the physical and mental health of nursing staff. The future resilience of healthcare services will depend on having sufficient numbers of nurses who are adequately resourced to face the coming challenges such as the new coronavirus COVID-19. Ninety-seven percent (181/186) of the MERS-CoV cases in Korea had exposure to the health care facilities (PMC_ID: PMC4630490). Three outbreaks of HCoV-OC43 in Melbourne establish this virus as a cause of morbidity in aged-care facilities and add to increasing evidence of the significance of coronavirus infections (PMC_ID: PMC2870246). All healthcare facilities should establish and implement infection prevention and control measure as well as triage policies and procedures for early detection and isolation of suspected MERS-CoV cases (PMC_ID: PMC4630490). In COVID-19 epidemic, the incidence of anxiety and stress disorder is high among medical staff. Medical institutions should strengthen the training of psychological skills of medical staff. Special attention should be paid to the mental health of female nurses. In hospitals there is above average risk for exposure to infectious diseases (PMC_ID: PMC4405869). The following baseline factors were independently associated with worse survival of SARS-CoV: older age (61–80 years), presence of an active comorbid condition and higher initial viral load of SARS coronavirus (PMC_ID: PMC527336). For MERS-CoV in Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia between 2014 and 2017, hospital mortality was 25%; septic shock/organ failure at admittance was a significant predictor of mortality (PMC_ID: PMC6805532). Higher initial viral load is independently associated with worse prognosis in SARS (PMC_ID: PMC527336). Mortality data for patients with SARS should be interpreted in light of age, comorbidity and viral load (PMC_ID: PMC527336). Pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome were the most common associated conditions that MERS-CoV patients had when they were admitted to the hospital (PMC_ID: PMC6805532). Advanced age was significantly associated with increased SARS-related deaths, primarily due to the onset of early- and late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis (PMC_ID: PMC2704758). Respiratory viruses can cause a wide spectrum of pulmonary diseases, ranging from mild, upper respiratory tract infections to severe and life-threatening lower respiratory tract infections, including the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (PMC_ID: PMC4267971). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause severe infection of the lower respiratory tract, with 10% and 35% overall mortality rates, respectively; however, >50% mortality rates are seen in the aged and immunosuppressed populations (PMC_ID: PMC4267971). Presenting with septic shock and organ failure at admission was significantly associated with hospital mortality for MERS-CoV (PMC_ID: PMC6805532). ECMO use, as a rescue therapy, was associated with lower mortality in MERS patients with refractory hypoxemia (PMC_ID: PMC5768582). Evidence supports the use of ECMO as a rescue therapy in patients with severe MERS-CoV (PMC_ID: PMC5768582). Although patients with cancer had worse outcomes from COVID-19, the median age of these patients (63·1 years) to be significantly higher than for those without cancer (48·7 years), suggesting that older age is associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Patients with cancer were more likely to develop COVID-19. Some patients of COVID-19 required supplemental oxygen and had variable clinical outcomes following treatment with an antiretroviral agent. Based on the clinical data of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP), as well as the dada from previous clinical studies and the recommendations from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO), the committee board of the Chinese Society of Extracorporeal Life Support (CSECLS) made this recommendations to guide clinical ECMO application in the patients with NCP. Advanced age correlated with more adverse disease outcomes following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in humans (PMC_ID: PMC3999990). The ICU mortality rate among those who required non-invasive ventilation was 23 (79%) of 29 and among those who required invasive mechanical ventilation was 19 (86%) of 22.2. It is not recommended to use of a high-flow nasal cannula or non-invasive ventilation until the patient has viral clearance. The CT imaging of COVID-19 patients showed multiple and scattered ground-glass opacity (GGO) in both lungs, which is similar to the CT performance of SARS and MERS in acute stage. Considered a relative of SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is a betacoronavirus that affects the lower respiratory tract and manifests as pneumonia in humans. If we assume that average levels of health care are similar throughout China, higher numbers of infections in a given population can be considered an indirect indicator of a heavier health-care burden. Full precautions should be applied and carefully followed to prevent the transmission of the virus, especially among health care workers (PMC_ID: PMC6695009). If everyone puts on a mask in public places, it would help to remove stigmatisation that has hitherto discouraged masking of symptomatic patients in many places. Transmission from asymptomatic infected individuals has been documented for COVID-19, and viral load is particularly high at early disease stage. It has long been recommended that for respiratory infections like influenza, affected patients should wear masks to limit droplet spread. While a surgical mask would normally provide adequate protection from large droplet spread, it does not prevent inhalation of smaller aerosolized particles such as those generated at autopsy (PMC_ID: PMC6490128). Public health experts say China is right to prioritize tracking sick patients who are spreading the disease. Executive agencies Public Health England (PHE)1 and Health Protection Scotland (HPS) have since published guidance to healthcare providers on managing patients suspected to have the disease. Consider covid-19 infection in anyone with cough, fever, or breathlessness who has had contact with someone with covid-19, or has returned from a high risk area in the 14 days before the onset of symptoms. Every effort should be made to avoid in-person assessment of patients with possible covid-19 in primary care. On Feb. 4, researchers from the AI drug discovery company BenevolentAI and Imperial College London reported that they had used AI software to find an already-approved drug that might limit the virus’s ability to infect people. Two independent groups last week reported that they had used artificial intelligence in different ways to find possible treatments for COVID-19. As the pandemic has developed, a fact has become apparent: there is a serious dearth of emergency medical supplies, and especially an extreme shortage of personal protective equipment such as masks and medical protective clothing. The prevention and control of novel coronavirus pneumonia is the most priority recently, and various measures during the prevention and control period will have varying degrees of impact on the implement of clinical trials. Mental health care should be provided for patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonitis, close contacts, suspected cases who are isolated at home, patients in fever clinics, families and friends of affected people, health professionals caring for infected patients, and the public who are in need. Clinical trial for COVID-19 was first registered on January 23, 2020. There are 125 clinical trials registered by February 18, 2020, focusing on the treatment of COVID-19. Limited existing knowledge highlights the need for data regarding supportive care and adjunctive pharmacologic therapy that is specific for critically ill patients with severe respiratory viral infections. Strong evidence to support early and routine use of ribavirin and steroid combination therapy in all SARS patients does not exist (PMC_ID: PMC3016795)."

    "#### Task 6: What do we know about non-pharmaceutical interventions?\n",
    "The current outbreak of COVID-19 reminds us how urgent this promise is and just how critical it is to continue to sustain and strengthen US's public health infrastructure. U.S. public health authorities are monitoring the situation closely, and CDC is coordinating efforts with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other global partners.Executive agencies Public Health England (PHE)1 and Health Protection Scotland (HPS) have since published guidance to healthcare providers on managing patients suspected to have the disease. CDC, state and local health departments, multiple other federal agencies, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow and try to contain transmission of COVID-19 in the United States, which the identification of cases and contacts of persons with COVID-19 in the United States and the recommended assessment, monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission. Interventions to minimize mortality from the MERS-CoV should particularly focus individuals with comorbidity, non-health-care workers, patients with no clinical fatal experience, and patients without any clinical and subclinical experiences (PMC_ID: PMC5536289). Assay designs are provided for detection of 67 viral species and subspecies, including: SARS-CoV-2, phylogenetically-related viruses, and viruses with similar clinical presentation. The designs are outputs of algorithms that are developed for rapidly designing nucleic acid detection assays that are comprehensive across genomic diversity and predicted to be highly sensitive and specific. As part of these social distancing policies, the Chinese Government encouraged people to stay at home; discouraged mass gatherings; cancelled or postponed large public events; and closed schools, universities, government offices, libraries, museums, and factories. Government policies enacted during the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday are likely to have helped reduce the spread of the virus by decreasing contact and increasing physical distance between those who have COVID-19 and those who do not. In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the Chinese Government has ordered a nationwide school closure as an emergency measure to prevent spreading of the infection. Although these measures and efforts are highly commendable and necessary, there are reasons to be concerned because prolonged school closure and home confinement during a disease outbreak might have negative effects on children's physical and mental health. Misinformation spreads panic among the general population and is not conducive to implementation of epidemic control measures. Although COVID-19 is spread by the airborne route, air disinfection of cities and communities is not known to be effective for disease control and needs to be stopped. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, some countries have suspended flights to and from China, and prevented Chinese people from travelling to their countries; both of these actions violate WHO International Health Regulations. Demographic factors, such as race, smoking status, and socioeconomic status, may confer an increased risk of susceptibility to CoV (PMC_ID: PMC2593164). Significant associations of coronavirus seropositivity and antibody levels with age, gender, race, socioeconomic status, smoking status, and season of the blood draw were tested with chi-square and regression analyses (PMC_ID: PMC2593164). Disease severity of MERS-CoV has been linked to patient health status, as people with chronic diseases or an immunocompromised status fare worse, although the mechanisms of disease have yet to be elucidated (PMC_ID: PMC5816332). Factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status were identified that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic. The immune status has direct influence on MERS-CoV shedding and subsequent potential of transmission (PMC_ID: PMC5816332). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Infection of the lung tissue and resident immune cells, such as alveolar macrophages, leads to the hyper-production of inflammatory cytokines and immune cell recruitment chemokines, which together limit MERS-CoV replication, but result in an immunopathologic state (PMC_ID: PMC5816332). A global epidemic of misinformation—spreading rapidly through social media platforms and other outlets—poses a serious problem for public health. What is at stake during an outbreak is making sure people will do the right thing to control the disease or to mitigate its impact. With social media, misinformation is amplified, it goes faster and further, like the viruses that travel with people and go faster and further. Although China has made great efforts to strengthen the ability to quickly respond to public health emergencies since the SARS outbreak in 2003 and it has clarified requirements for emergency supplies through legislation, the emergency reserve supplies program has not been effectively implemented, and there are also deficiencies in the types, quantity, and availability of emergency medical supplies. Challenges such as lacking effective drugs, insufficient hospital services and medical supplies, logistics, etc. have much alleviated with the solidarity of the whole society. The pandemic will definitely be ended with the continuous efforts of both national and international multi-sectoral bodies."

    "#### Task 7: Sample task with sample submission\n",
    "COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Since the beginning of 2020, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread throughout China. Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19."

As an ongoing epidemic, few studies had worked on examing geographic variations of COVID-19 by the time the dataset was generated. Therefore, when querying with the terms \"geographic variations\", not many relevant articles were retrieved. A potential improvement would be instead of using general terms, using specific geographic locations such as countries in the queries, which may help retrieve articles that each focused on the disease in a different area."

    "#### Task 8: What do we know about diagnostics and surveillance?\n",
    "Undertaking clinical trials of convalescent plasma for passive immunotherapy of MERS-CoV infection may be feasible, but such trials would be challenging because of the small pool of potential donors with sufficiently high antibody titers (PMC_ID: PMC4994343). Alternative strategies to identify convalescent plasma donors with adequate antibody titers should be explored, including the sampling of serum from patients with more severe disease and sampling at earlier points during illness (PMC_ID: PMC4994343). An indirect MERS-CoV S ELISA has been developed to be used as part of serological determination for evidence of previous exposure to the MERS-CoV (PMC_ID: PMC6158782). It is possible that earlier sampling would have resulted in the detection of more reactivity and higher antibody titers (PMC_ID: PMC4994343). Harmonisation and standardisation of laboratory methods are essential for surveillance and for a rapid and effective international response to emerging diseases (PMC_ID: PMC6361340). During the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Republic of Korea in 2015, serious challenges emerged regarding important ethical issues, such as transparency and the protection of privacy (PMC_ID: PMC4750516). If we do not include ethical values and principles explicitly in pandemic planning in advance, the next response to an epidemic may result in widespread breaches of ethical principles, leading to deeper confusion and non-cooperation (PMC_ID: PMC4750516). One study showed an enormous response capacity achieved through coordination of academic and public laboratories in national and European research networks in response to COVID-19 (PMC_ID: PMC6988269). The laboratory capacity not only supports immediate public health interventions but enables sites to enrol patients during rapid clinical research responses. National, provincial/state/territorial, and municipal governments, as well as the health care sector, should ensure that their pandemic plans include an ethical component (PMC_ID: PMC4750516). Aggressive measures implemented by CDC, state and local health departments, multiple other federal agencies, and other partners require the identification of cases and contacts of persons with COVID-19 in the United States and the recommended assessment, monitoring, and care of travelers arriving from areas with substantial COVID-19 transmission. Although these measures might not prevent widespread transmission of the virus in the United States, they are being implemented to 1) slow the spread of illness; 2) provide time to better prepare state and local health departments, health care systems, businesses, educational organizations, and the general public in the event that widespread transmission occurs; and 3) better characterize COVID-19 to guide public health recommendations and the development and deployment of medical countermeasures, including diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. WHO guidelines produced in the context of a public health emergency can be improved upon, helping to assure the trustworthiness and utility of WHO information products in future emergencies. To accelerate our pace and meet the challenges of current and future health threats, we must advance our world-class data and analytics capabilities; maintain and expand our state-of-the-art public health laboratory capacity; continue building a workforce of trusted, expert, public health professionals; sustain our capacity to rapidly respond to outbreaks at their source; and assure a strong global and domestic preparedness capacity. The unprecedented pace of the public health response to COVID-19 has only been possible because of prior investments in public health preparedness. CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States. A rapid and simple point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay has been developed, which can detect IgM and IgG antibodies simultaneously against SARS-CoV-2 virus in human blood within 15 minutes which can detect patients at different infection stages. The medical community is rallying to develop a set of rapid and reliable molecular diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2. China had five commercial tests on the market 1 month ago and can now do up to 1.6 million tests a week; South Korea has tested 65,000 people so far. Assay designs were provided for detection of 67 viral species and subspecies, including: SARS-CoV-2, phylogenetically-related viruses, and viruses with similar clinical presentation. Cooperation between the government and private sector experts was very effective in facing MERS-CoV in Korea (PMC_ID: PMC4945729). The efforts of government and private sector experts overcame the initial chaos situation caused by MERS-CoV (PMC_ID: PMC4945729). The genetic drift of the S gene is likely to be one of the mechanisms of the adaptation evolution of HCoV-OC43 (PMC_ID: PMC4476415). Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of COVID-19 would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. Taking into account the persisting lack of specific antiviral treatments (there is, in fact, no specific treatment available to fight coronaviruses infections), the Coronaviridae specificities (i.e. pathogenicity, potential environmental resistance) make them a challenging model for the development of efficient means of prevention, as an adapted antisepsis-disinfection, to prevent the environmental spread of such infective agents (PMC_ID: PMC3509683). Viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 may be different from that of previously reported other coronavirus infections such as SARS-CoV. Animal models are utilized to gain insight into the pathogenesis of disease with the overall goal of identifying potential targets for intervention and evaluating specific therapeutics and vaccines (PMC_ID: PMC3644300). There may be potential to test suspected cases in real time based on questionnaire responses, travel origin, or borderline symptoms; at least one PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 claimed to take less than an hour has already been announced (PMC_ID: PMC7060038). Traveller screening is being used to limit further spread of COVID-19 following its recent emergence, and symptom screening has become a ubiquitous tool in the global response (PMC_ID: PMC7060038). National and regional leaders, policy makers, and stakeholders should be prompted to advocate and enhance adoption of the One Health framework to mitigate the risk for Middle East respiratory syndrome and other emerging zoonotic diseases (PMC_ID: PMC6390738). Most of the GCC countries, including those with high MERS-CoV incidence, have adopted an epidemic control policy, indicating that the One Health approach was either partially embraced or totally overlooked (PMC_ID: PMC6390738). Launched at Davos in January 2017 with funding from sovereign investors and philanthropic institutions, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is an innovative partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil organisations whose mission is to stimulate, finance and co-ordinate vaccine development against diseases with epidemic potential in cases where market incentives fail. For new test development, sourcing clinical material continues to be a major challenge to achieving assay validation (PMC_ID: PMC6361340). A platform has been developed that can be rapidly applied to new, emerging diseases with efficacy in vulnerable populations and in the context of heterologous challenge (PMC_ID: PMC5952155). Rapid production and publication of pathogen genome sequences during emerging disease outbreaks provide crucial public health information. State-of-the-art sequencing technology and bioinformatic analysis can quickly provide critical insight into the viral genome sequence, phylogeny, replication strategy, and potential drug and vaccine targets and generate tools to evaluate the possible epidemic risk associated with this novel human virus (PMC_ID: PMC3546555). The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing tool was released as a free-of-charge resource in the third week of January 2020 in order to help the rapid characterization of COVID-19 infections. The tool has been able to correctly classify all the recently released SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as well as all the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak sequences In conclusion, the Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool is a webbased and user-friendly software application that allows the identification and characterization of novel coronavirus genomes. The rapid genomic sequencing and open access data, together with advanced vaccine technology, are expected to give us more knowledge on the pathogen itself, including the host immune response as well as the plan for therapeutic vaccines in the near future. In the context of disease emergence from wildlife, wildlife and habitat should be conserved, which in turn will preserve vital ecosystem structure and function, which has broader implications for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability, while simultaneously minimizing the spillover of pathogens from wild animals into human beings (PMC_ID: PMC3427567). Data suggested an evolutionary origin of 229E-related CoVs in hipposiderid bats, hypothetically with camelids as intermediate hosts preceding the establishment of HCoV-229E (PMC_ID: PMC4645311). Interventions to decrease the probability of virus spillover can be implemented at multiple levels from targeting the reservoir host to managing recipient host exposure and susceptibility (PMC_ID: PMC4262174)."

    "#### Task 9: What has been published about ethical and social science considerations?\n",
    "If we do not include ethical values and principles explicitly in pandemic planning in advance, the next response to an epidemic may result in widespread breaches of ethical principles, leading to deeper confusion and non-cooperation (PMC_ID: PMC4750516). Pandemic planning enriched with ethical principles will facilitate efficiency, voluntariness, and legitimacy (PMC_ID: PMC4750516). Public health actions need to incorporate clear and systematic procedures founded upon ethical principles (PMC_ID: PMC4750516). During the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Republic of Korea in 2015, serious challenges emerged regarding important ethical issues, such as transparency and the protection of privacy (PMC_ID: PMC4750516). Public engagement and civic partnership with public health authorities to discuss ethical principles are essential to foster community participation, collaboration, and solidarity from the civil society (PMC_ID: PMC4750516). Ethical considerations are essential in planning for and responding to outbreaks of infectious diseases (PMC_ID: PMC4750516). The MERS-CoV epidemic in Korea created significant public support for more aggressive early interventions in future outbreaks (PMC_ID: PMC4750516). There is a need to integrate basic and clinical research for investigating the connections between molecular and clinical pathogenesis and for therapeutic development strategies (PMC_ID: PMC6131701). A global epidemic of misinformation—spreading rapidly through social media platforms and other outlets—poses a serious problem for public health. It is crucial that the field of epidemic science matures to place patients at the heart of the response (PMC_ID: PMC5165716). Immediately after COVID-19 was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, WHO's risk communication team launched a new information platform called WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN), with the aim of using a series of amplifiers to share tailored information with specific target groups. In addition, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must implement specific strategies of action including taking on the role of “control tower” in a public health emergency, training of Field Epidemic Intelligence Service officers, establishment of collaborative governance between central and local governments for infection prevention and control, strengthening the roles and capabilities of community-based public hospitals, and development of nationwide crisis communication methods (PMC_ID: PMC4676643). In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, the Chinese Government has ordered a nationwide school closure as an emergency measure to prevent spreading of the infection. Preparedness for and an appropriate response to a public health crisis require comprehensive systematic public healthcare measures to address risks comprehensively with an all-hazards approach (PMC_ID: PMC4676643). It is desirable to educate the population regarding health and preventive behaviors for infectious diseases regularly at schools and public institutions (PMC_ID: PMC6616393). Although surgical masks are in widespread use by the general population, there is no evidence that these masks prevent the acquisition of COVID-19, although they might slightly reduce the spread from an infected patient. The main outcome variables were nonpharmaceutical preventive measures (survey (1): Measures for reducing transmission (handwashing, face masks); and survey (2): Measures for avoiding contact with others) (PMC_ID: PMC6616393). Some of the epidemiological characteristics of 2019-nCoV have been identified. However, there remain considerable uncertainties, which should be considered when providing guidance to public health authorities on control measures (PMC_ID: PMC7011107). High-filtration masks such as N95 masks and protective clothing (goggles and gowns) should be used in hospitals where health-care workers are in direct contact with infected patients. This notification contained a reference to mental health problems and interventions that occurred during the 2003 SARS outbreak, and mentioned that mental health care should be provided for patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonitis, close contacts, suspected cases who are isolated at home, patients in fever clinics, families and friends of affected people, health professionals caring for infected patients, and the public who are in need. The observations of mental health consequences and measures taken during the 2003 SARS outbreak could help inform health authorities and the public to provide mental health interventions to those who are in need. So far, mental health care for the patients and health professionals directly affected by the 2019-nCoV epidemic has been under-addressed, although the National Health Commission of China released the notification of basic principles for emergency psychological crisis interventions for the 2019-nCoV pneumonia on Jan 26, 2020. To achieve higher efficacy of the public health interventions, efforts from individuals should not be neglected. Discrimination and prejudice driven by fear or misinformation have been flowing globally, superseding evidence and jeopardizing the anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 efforts (PMC_ID: PMC7052559). As global community, we need solidarity instead of stigma or discrimination to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (PMC_ID: PMC7052559). WHO's newly launched platform aims to combat misinformation around COVID-19. Social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, are now frequently utilized to address health-related issues (PMC_ID: PMC4642378). The covid-19 epidemic is not only viral—it is also digital. "

    "#### Task 10: What has been published about information sharing and inter-sectoral collaboration?\n",
    "One study demonstrates the enormous response capacity achieved through coordination of academic and public laboratories in national and European research networks in facing COVID-19 (PMC_ID: PMC6988269). Through coordination between academic and public laboratories, we confirmed assay exclusivity based on 297 original clinical specimens containing a full spectrum of human respiratory viruses (PMC_ID: PMC6988269). To promote the data sharing and make all relevant information of 2019-nCoV publicly available, we construct the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource (2019nCoVR, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov). 2019nCoVR features comprehensive integration of genomic and proteomic sequences as well as their metadata information from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, National Center for Biotechnology Information, China National GeneBank, National Microbiology Data Center and China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB)/National Genomics Data Center (NGDC). It also incorporates a wide range of relevant information including scientific literatures, news, and popular articles for science dissemination, and provides visualization functionalities for genome variation analysis results based on all collected 2019-nCoV strains. The rapid sharing of sequence information as seen throughout the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, represents an inflection point for genomic epidemiology. For MERS-CoV, it is necessary to explore the current information-seeking strategies and preferences for communication tools among the Saudi population to promote dissemination of accurate information (PMC_ID: PMC4883030). By linking seamlessly with related databases in CNCB/NGDC, 2019nCoVR offers virus data submission and sharing services for raw sequence reads and assembled sequences. Immediately after COVID-19 was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, WHO's risk communication team launched a new information platform called WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN), with the aim of using a series of amplifiers to share tailored information with specific target groups. It is not only information to make sure people are informed; it is also making sure people are informed to act appropriately. Important information on epidemiology, bat biology and ecology is often not available to make informed decisions on zoonotic spillover potential. Knowledge of the diversity of coronaviruses in wildlife is essential to better understand and prevent emergence events (PMC_ID: PMC5744139). The laboratory capacity not only supports immediate public health interventions but enables sites to enrol patients during rapid clinical research responses (PMC_ID: PMC6988269). The speed and effectiveness of the present deployment and evaluation effort were enabled by national and European research networks established in response to international health crises in recent years, demonstrating the enormous response capacity that can be released through coordinated action of academic and public laboratories (PMC_ID: PMC6988269). The unprecedented pace of the public health response to COVID-19 has only been possible because of prior investments in public health preparedness. Implementing an innovative electronic surveillance system called syndromic surveillance system is essential for global health security (PMC_ID: PMC7008581). CDC, multiple other federal agencies, state and local health departments, and other partners are implementing aggressive measures to slow transmission of 2019-nCoV in the United States. As more is learned about this novel virus and this outbreak, CDC will rapidly incorporate new knowledge into guidance for action by CDC, state and local health departments, health care providers, and communities. It is of great practical significance and has important implications for long-term health care to explore and analyze in the perspective of the situation of COVID-19 its philosophical values, cultural values, methodological values, social values and the national strategic value of 'healthy China'. The current outbreak of COVID-19 reminds us how urgent this promise is and just how critical it is to continue to sustain and strengthen our nation's public health infrastructure. Community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past ten years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. To accelerate our pace and meet the challenges of current and future health threats, we must advance our world-class data and analytics capabilities; maintain and expand our state-of-the-art public health laboratory capacity; continue building a workforce of trusted, expert, public health professionals; sustain our capacity to rapidly respond to outbreaks at their source; and assure a strong global and domestic preparedness capacity. Full precautions should be applied and carefully followed to prevent the transmission of the virus, especially among health care workers (PMC_ID: PMC6695009). Although COVID-19 involves mostly mild infections among the majority of the general population, the risk of death among young adults is higher than that of seasonal influenza, and elderly with underlying comorbidities require additional care. In the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, health authorities must cope with the uncertainty in the risk of death from COVID-19, and high-risk individuals should be identified using approaches that can address the abovementioned three problems. Closure of certain routes, targeted airport screening, risk communication, public awareness and targeted training and vigilance of health workers associated with the portals of entry of visitors to their countries will help mitigate the force of further spread of 2019-nCoV. This guideline includes the guideline methodology, epidemiological characteristics, disease screening and population prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control (including traditional Chinese Medicine), nosocomial infection prevention and control, and disease nursing of the 2019-nCoV (PMC_ID: PMC7003341). Increased public health response including early case recognition, isolation of identified case, contract tracing and targeted airport screening, public awareness and vigilance of health workers will help mitigate the force of further spread to naïve countries. US federal public health travel restrictions are mechanisms to mitigate spread of communicable diseases and might be critical in enhancing health security during epidemics (PMC_ID: PMC5711296). Published guidance recommends controlled movement for persons with higher-risk exposures (HREs) to communicable diseases of public health concern; US federal public health travel restrictions (PHTRs) might be implemented to enforce these measures (PMC_ID: PMC5711296). Covid-19 is rapidly spreading around the world during a period when many healthcare systems are already under pressure. To accelerate our pace and meet the challenges of current and future health threats, we must advance our world-class data and analytics capabilities; maintain and expand our state-of-the-art public health laboratory capacity; continue building a workforce of trusted, expert, public health professionals; sustain our capacity to rapidly respond to outbreaks at their source; and assure a strong global and domestic preparedness capacity. This necessitates a multidisciplinary One Health approach to close knowledge gaps and ensure the development of responsible mitigation strategies to not only minimize risk of infection but also ensure conservation of the species. Under the premise of comprehensively implementing various emergency treatment tasks and ensuring the normal operation of other wards, the Nursing Department has put in place emergency plans and deployed due manpower for rapid response, timely personnel deployment, and reasonable reserve echelon structure. Given that the One Health approach is increasingly recognized internationally as an effective trend for managing emerging diseases at the human-animal-environment interface, the key barrier fostering the One Health approach at the national level suggested by this study seems to be the relative lack of political will (PMC_ID: PMC6390738)."
